Walden
- The devil finds work for the idle
- Starving not of necessities but of wants
- If you give money, spend yourself with it
- To affect the quality of the day is the highest of arts
- If some have the fortune to ride upon the rails, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon
- By such a pile we should hope to scale heaven at last
- Lived so far from society that visits were more intentional and richer
- Men of business thought only of solitude and employment (said they loved to ramble in the woods but clearly did not) and ministers who spoke of god as if they had a monopoly of the subject but could not hear all kinda of opinions
- Not until we are lost do we begin to find ourselves and realize the infinite extent of our relations
- It is a vulgar error to suppose you have tasted huckleberries who never plucked them
- All the change is in me (in reference to the pond)
- Mop on hand but no effects of it visible anywhere
- A boy who has never fired a gun is no more humane but his education has been sadly neglected
- Not the food that entereth the mouth defiles a man but the appetite with which it is eaten
- The phenomena of a year take place in a pond every day on a small scale
- I trust it would be nobler game to shoot oneself
