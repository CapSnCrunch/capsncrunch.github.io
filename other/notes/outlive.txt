Outlive
- The activities of daily living
- Exercise: strength, stability, aerobic efficiency, and peak aerobic capacity
- Nutrition
- Sleep
- Mendelian randomization (across genetics with some constraints to limit bias)
- Antagonistic pleiotropy (beneficial gene earlier becomes harmful later)
- Caloric Restriction (CR), AMP-K triggers construction of new mitochondria (fuel efficient restriction of mTOR)
- Dexa Scan for visceral fat
- Calcium and LDL-c, LP-a, APO-c (lipoproteins) check in blood, don’t limit fats in general but fats of certain lipid profiles
- “The Transformed Cell”
- Obesity and diabetes are the next highest predictors of cancer behind smoking (metabolic disfunction in general)
- Amyloid Beta (for Alzheimer’s)
- Sauna benefit for Alzheimer’s (at least 4 sessions per week for at least 20 minutes)
- Magnitude of impact of exercise is surprising (VO2 Max is the best indicator of longevity)
- Training zones (zone 2)
- Metabolic flexibility
- “Feeling the burn” is lactate which indicates you are out of zone 2 (want a sustainable endurance)
- Aerobic respiration vs glycolysis 
- Mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy
- Roughly expect 2 watts per kilo
- Training “carrying” (rucking, gripping, pulling, etc.)
- Concentric vs eccentric loading
- Theoretical “optimal” form for different exercises
- Stability
- DNS (Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization), sequence of NM development in children (study on cerebral palsy and presenting same sequence of movements) which can be forgotten if not expressed / remembered
    - Form for “breathing” (sympathetic vs parasympathetic nervous system)
    - The “neurophysiological” lens of the world (seeing your and other people’s form and instinctive behavior)
    - Feet and quality shoes (toe yoga)
    - “Tech neck”
    - Feeling each vertebrae by a slower version of yoga
    - Hands as an “interface” for the world
- In order to go faster, you need to go slower
- Three diet strategies (CR - tracking and reducing what you eat, DR - cutting out certain foods, TR - giving yourself set times to eat)
- Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)
- Only birds and non-aquatic mammals experience REM sleep (spinal fluid literally clean out the gaps between neurons)
    - Trazidone?
    - CBTI
- Resume virtues vs eulogy virtues
