On Bullshit
- The Prevalence of Humbug
    - Deceptive misrepresentation (dependent on the perpetrators state of mind)
    - “Short of Lying”
- Being pretentious as a motive but not a constitutive part of bullshit
- Misrepresentation of thoughts constitutes two deceptions; the actual state of the thing and the deceivers belief about it
    - Though arguably, this only provides a reasonable basis for judgements about the deceivers belief and is not an explicit statement
- Intentional of humbug is to misrepresent the self (don’t care about the listeners belief of the actual statement you’re saying)
- Wittgenstein combatting non-sense (to the point of calling out similes)
- Characterization of “feel like a dog that’s been run over” is not a lie, but has excessive specificity
    - Disconnected from concern with the truth
    - Not “wrought with the greatest care”, not working with the constraints of the true scenario to provide an accurate description
- Speakers in “bull sessions” as testing / discovering how others respond to thoughts and attitudes without assumption they are committed to them
- “Hot air” as a suitable replacement for “bullshit” in that it lacks informative content
- Difference between falsity and fakery in lying and bullshit
- “Bullshit” then, as the concealed lack of central interest in the truth values of statements (rather than the concealed intent to deceive with lying)
- “Lying” by St. Augustine
- Generation of bullshit stimulated by obligation or opportunity of a person to speak on a topic at a level exceeding their knowledge or expertise
