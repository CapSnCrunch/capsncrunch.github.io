- Conviction
- Why does a new fervor arise when contradictory evidence is presented? There are a few conditions:
    - Belief held with deep conviction with some relevance to action
    - Person is committed to it (had taken some irresistible action)
    - Belief must be specific
    - Undeniable evidence must occur and be recognized by the believer
    - Believer must have social support (proselyting)
- Millennial and messianic movements
- Millerites (New England farmer predicting the end of the world, late 1830s, strong disappointment but then renewed fervor)
- Christianity meets similar conditions
- Dissonance resolved by:
    - Changing one or more of beliefs
    - Acquire new beliefs to reduce dissonance
