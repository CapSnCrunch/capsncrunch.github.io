A Philosophy of Walking
- Walking is the best way to go more slowly than any other method that has ever been found
- Outside as a tunnel between places or for the sake of itself (as children more often use it)
- Slowness as the opposite of haste
- “Adieu to here, no matter where”
- Walking means going forward, to go back would mean wasted hours
- Arthur Rimbaud
- Whatever liberates you from time and space alienates you from speed (freeing our illusions of the essential)
- “A great rucksack revolution”
- “Solitude too can be shared like bread and daylight”
- The natural man loves but never favors himself
- “As if you could kill time without injuring eternity” (Thoreau)
- Dromomania, poriomania, automatic walking
- Sensing the physiology of a book and its author (how was it written?)
- Through walking can experience different states of well being to different degrees rather than maximizing on any in particular
- Walking permits handful on novel encounters clearing path to “pleasure”
- Mountain hikes give way to narcissistic gratification and are not “pure” walks
- The tourist and persevering walker do not see the same thing; a difference in gratitude
- Aesthetic, ethical, and religious phases of walking throughout life
- Gyrovagues and Xenateia
- The necessary isn’t imposed, it’s discovered (an ascetics conquest)
