The Mythical Man Month

    - Program can be extended in two ways:
        - To a programming product (generalized, tested, documented, maintained)
        - To a programming system (component within a system of large tasks, precisely defined interfaces, explicit budget, E2E testing across interactions)
    - A programming systems product is the desired product
    - The joys of the craft (sheer joy of making things, things useful to other people, fashioning complex puzzle like object within systems, joy of always learning, working with tractable medium)
    - The woes of the craft (one must perform perfectly, other people set objectives, dependence upon others, grand concepts are fun but little bugs is just work, appears obsolete upon completion)
    
    Projects often fail for lack of calendar time
    - Techniques for estimating are poorly developed
    - Techniques confuse effor with progress
    - We are uncertain of our estimates
    - Schedule progress is poorly monitored
    - Respones to schedule slippage is to add man power

    Incompleteness and inconsistencies are only apparent during implementation

    Programmers build from pure concepts but because medium is tractable, we are optimistic

    "Man-month" unit of effort are dangerous to use

    Partitionable, non-partitionable, and partitionable with communication tasks
    (with complex interrelationships, communication effort can cause tasks to take longer with more people)

    1/3 planning, 1/6 coding, 1/4 component test, 1/4 system test

    Regenerative Schedule Disaster
    - "Take no small slips"
    - Brook's Law (Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later)

Surgical Team

    The Problem
    - Measured magnitudes between good / bad programers is 10x
    - Small sharp team of no more than 10 is desired, but this is not enough for massive projects (too slow)

    Mills's Proposal
    - Each segment of a project be tackled by a team organized as a surgical team rather than hog-butchering
    (one doing the cutting and others give support that enhances effectiveness)
    - The surgeon (cheif programmer) - personally defines specs, writes, tests
    - The copilot (alter ego of surgeon) - able to do any part of job but less experienced, share in design as
    a thinker, discussant, evaluator (surgeon tries ideas but not bound by his advice)
    - The administrator - legal, contractual, reporting, financial requiremet management
    - The editor - criticizes, reworks, enhances output of the surgeon
    - Two secretaries - admin and edtior each need secretary to handle project correspondence and non-product files
    - The program clerk - maintain technical records in programming-product library
    - The toolsmith - unquestionably satisfactory reliability of tooling and its upgrades
    - The tester - bank of suitable test cases
    - The language lawyer - neat, efficient uses of language for doing difficult, obscure, or tricky things

    Scaling up to many teams requires new communication toolsmith

Aristocracy, Democracy, and System design

    Conceptual Integrity of design
    - How to achieve?
    - Does this imply elite architects and horde of plebian implenters?
    - How to keep architects from drifting off with unimplementable or costly specs?
    - How to ensure every detail is communicated?

    When a small architecture team will write all external specs, the implementers raise:
    - The specs will be too rich in function and not reflect practical costs
    - The architects get all the creative fun and shut out inventiveness of implementers
    - The many implementers must sit idly until specs come through narrow funnel

    The first is a real danger, the other are illusions:
    - Opportunity to be creative is not diminished given external specs
    - Implementer has plenty to do defining general components and setting up tools


The Second-System Effect

    What discipline bounds to architect's inventive enthusiasm?
    - Thoroughgoing, careful, and sympathetic communication between architect and builder

    When architect confronted with high cost estimate they can:
    - Cut the design
    - Challenge the estimate suggesting cheaper implementations
        - Must be suggestive, not dictated
        - Always be prepared to suggest a way of implementing anything he specifies and prepared to accept any other way that meets the objective well
        - Deal quietly and privately in such suggestions
        - Be ready to forego credit for suggested improvements

    Second system is the most dangerous a man ever designs (general tendency to over-design, use all the ideas and frills, forms a "big pile")

Passing the Word

    The manual or written spec is necessary but not sufficient (only an external spec of product)
    - Should describe everythign the user sees but refrain from describing what they do not see
    - Attractive to use formal notation instead of English to acheive precision (though they can require prose explanations to learn and teach)
    - "Never go to the sea with two chronomoters. Take one or three"

    Meetings are necessary, found two to be useful:
    - Weekly half-day conference of all architectus and official representatives of implementers and market planners (propose challenges, emphasis on creativity rather than merely decision)
    - Larger "fall festivals" every 6 months to 1 year to resolve backlogged issues

    Telephone log kept by architect recording every question and answer

Why Did the Tower of Babel Fail?

    Poor communication and organization

    The Project Workbook
    - What (all documents of the project)
    - Why (control of distribution of information, tree-structure)
    - Mechanics

    Microfiche?

Calling the Shot

    Many non-coding, testing, designing etc. tasks are not considered (communication, documents, bugs, etc.)

Ten Pounds in a Five-Pound Stack

    Representation is the essence of programming
    - "Beyond craftsmanship lies inventionship, and it is here that lean, spare, fast programs are born"
    - Almost always these are the result of strategic breakthrouhg rather than tactical cleverness (planned refactors and representation rather than fancy new algorithm)
    - "Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables and I won't usually need your flowcharts; they'll be obvious."

The Documentary Hypothesis

    Documents for a Computer Product:
    - Objectives
    - Specifications
    - Schedule
    - Budget
    - Organization Chart
    - Space Allocations
    - Estimate, forecast, prices

    These are similar to those defined by university departments

Plan to Throw One Away

    Chemical engineers learned the need for a "pilot plant"
    First system is often barely usuable (too slow, too bug, too awkward to use)
        - Must restart with a redesigned version either in one lump or piece-by-piece
        - Management question is not whether to build a pilot system but whether to plan in advance to build one or promise to deliver the throwaway to customers
        (doing so buys time but at the cost of agont for the user, distraction for the builders, and bad reputation for the product)

    Plan the system for change
    Plan the organization for change
    - "By documenting a design, the designer exposes himself to the criticisms of everyone, and he must be able to defend everything he writes. If the organizational
    structure is threatening in any way, nothing is going to be documented until it is completely defensible."
    - Each person must be assigned to jobs that broaden them
    - Large projects require keeping the top two or three people as technical calvary that can be moved around

    To avoid perception of seniors as "too valuable" for actual programming, abolish job titles and just use "Member of Technical Staff" (as Bell Labs did)

    Horizontal movement between "managerial" and "technical" latters should be "reassignments" and not "promotions"

Sharp Tools

    "A good workman is known by his tools"

    Individualized tools hamper rather than aid communication, but general-purpose tools are also not enough

    One tool-maker per team that decides:
    - A computer facility
    - An operating system
    - A language / language policy
    - Utilities, debugging aids, test-case generators, and text-processing system for documentation

The Whole and the Parts

    "I can write programs that control air traffic, intercept ballistic missles, reconcile bank accounts, and control prduction lines."
    "So can I, and so can any man, but do they work when you do write them?"

    "The most pernicious and subtle bugs are system bugs arising from mismatched assumptions made by the authors of various system components."

    Build a specification before code is written and test it

    Top-down design refining individual modules at a time

    Djikstra suggested building programs only from loops and conditional portions and that the alternative, unrestrained use of branching via GO TO
    produces structures that lend themselves to logical errors.

    Build plenty of scaffolding in the form of programs / data for debugging that are not intended to be in the final product.
    - Dummy components with mocked data
    - Miniature file

Hatching a Catastrophe

    "None love the bearer of bad news."
    "How does a project get to be a year late? ...One day at a time."

    Milestonse or Millstones?
    - First step is to have a schedule with a list of milestones (crucially dependent on experience)
    - "Debugging is 90% finished half of the coding time, debugging is 99% complete most of the time, and 'planning complete' can be proclaimed almost at will."
    - Concrete milestoens shuold be 100% complete events (sharp milestones are a service to the team)

    "Hustle" as an essential gift of great players; it provides the cushion, reservem and capacity that allows for a team to cope with routine mishaps

    PERT (critical-path scheduling in which one estimates three times for each event corresponding to different probabilities of meeting the estimated dates)

    Under the rug (first-line managers are not inclined to report minor slippage)
    - Bosses need to see exceptions to the plan that require action and status picture for education. They can use two rug-lifting techniques:
        - Reducing the role conflict (don't act on problems managers can solve and never on problems where he is explicitly only reviewing status. distinguish status-review from problem-action)
        - Yanking the rug off (PERT chart with frequent sharp milestones can be the basis to see actual completions)
