Hidden Technical Debt in ML Systems

Complex Models Erode Boundaries
- CACE
    - Isolate models and serve ensembles
    - Focus on detecting changes in prediction behavior as they occur
- Correction Cascades
    - Either eat the cost of making a new model or try and tweak the existing model directly
- Undeclared Consumers (visibility debt in classical software)
Data Dependencies Cost More than Code Dependencies
- Unstable Data Dependencies (TF/IDF scores?)
    - Create versioned copies of data dependencies (frozen versions of mappings)
- Underutilized Data Dependencies (â€œ92 impact predictors from legacy features, bundled features, epsilon features, or correlated features)
    - Detect and remove exhaustively with leave-one-feature-out evaluations
- Static Analysis for Data Dependencies
