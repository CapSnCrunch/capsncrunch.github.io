To Sell is Human
- Fuller Brush Salesman (the last being Norman Hall)
- In a world of the internet, it seems technology has made intermediaries like sales people irrelevant
- In reality, it appears that the ease of starting entrepreneurial endeavors has only been made easier, making it essential for more people to engage in some form of selling (think Etsy, Kickstarter, EBay, etc.)
- From US bureau of labor statistics, 1 in 9 people work in sales (at all scales)
- 20% of workforce in Canada, 10% in Australia, 13% in EU, 1 in 8 for Japan
- “Non-sales Selling”
- Producing and consuming are typically viewed as most important but “moving” is a major part of this
- Survey of 7k found we spend around 24min of every hour for “selling” (though not directly, but through “persuading”, “explaining”, etc.)
- The Pixar Pitch
- Differences in degree vs differences in kind within small vs large orgs (need to wear many hats within startup)
- Products people buy vs products people are sold
- Everyone the customer touches is essentially a salesperson
- Elasticity of skills
- To sell is to convince someone or part with resources such that they are better off after the transaction
- Issue of asymmetric information between seller and buyer
- The internet helps break down this information asymmetry
- Caveat venditor (seller beware), sellers are now curators and clarifiers of info (not protectors and purveyors)
- Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity
- Social cartography (who are the decision makers and how are they related)
- Chameleon effect and subtle / strategic mimicry
- No correlation between extroversion and sales performance and volume
- Buoyancy in the ocean of rejection
- A combination of levity and gravity, negativity and positivity
- Interrogative vs declarative self-talk
- Addition can subtract, less is more
- To sell yourself, it is best to emphasize your potential rather than your achievements (the uncertainty can lead people to think more deeply)
- Irrational questions motivate people better
- “Yes, and…”
- Servant leadership
- “Upserve” vs “Upsell”
