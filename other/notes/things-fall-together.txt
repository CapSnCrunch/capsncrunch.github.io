Things Fall Together
Programming Matter
- The Industrial Revolution ruined our perception and craftsmanship with materials
- The Digital Revolution changed our perception about what it means to be a “smart” material (we think it needs to have software)
- Programmable materials / active matter
- Computer Aided Design (CAD)
- Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC)
- Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)

Computing is Physical
- Morphological Computing, the interplay of objects to perform computation
- Computationally Universal, requires conditional branching and read-write functionality
- Biological computers and microfluidics
- Materials can communicate as hybrid collaborators with electronics, or as remote sensors on their own
- Creative computing
- Materials can embody polymorphism (something that responds to heat and moisture on their own will have a unique reaction to hot water)
- Morphogensis
- “A New Kind of Science”: patterns can be growth/death, repetitive, chaotic/noisy, oscillation between chaotic and ordered

Order from Chaos
- “Life is the fundamental pursuit of negative entropy”
- Entropy and Maxwells Demon
- Design a system so that the lowest energy state is the most useful / interesting one
- Self-Assembly had a transition phase where you need the right amount of energy based on several factors (material, medium, size, density, bonds, temperature, etc.)
- Helium Balloons with Velcro nodes form random lattices (generally useful to consider the “stickiness” of components and connection strength once stuck)
- Granular convection (differences in size and density causes components to separate when mixed and vice versa)
- “Male to female” connections may have a stronger chance of holding while the other combinations are weaker
- Patterned Error Correction: Generally useful to have several “lock and key” components to guarantee they match when connected
- Can print fabricated magnetic patterns to have any complementary magnetic pair

Less Is Smart
- “Smart” products are usually complex, require power, easier to break, etc.
- Flexibility of components is a type of error correction
- Granular jamming (redundancy, rocks and string)

Robots Without Robots
- 4D printing (3D printing a multi-material object that can transform with exposure to water, heat, and light)
- Materials can be both actuators and sensors

Build from the Bottom Up
- Stigmergy (intelligent collaboration on an individual agent scale instead of a top down plan)
- Decentralized drones and other robots
- Surrender of control to these bottom up processes is hard but can be productive (delegation)
- There is overhead for getting an emergent process to work for a pre-designed product, but it pays off by being scalable
- Destruction as construction (muscle building, forest fires, coastal storms, etc.)

Design from the Bottom Up
- Design > Build > Function > Dispose
- Material > Assembly > Design > Adaptation
- Easier to evolve around constraints to create many solutions than trying to come up with one on your own
- Design by chaos, design by committee, genius designer, design as optimization, design as adaptation
- Hardware version of softwares “deploy early and often”

Reverse, Reuse, Recycle
- Customization allows for gradual evolution and is less wasteful
- Rapid Liquid Printing (RLP) allows for quick production of soft robotics which typically requires a mold
- Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
- Stereolithography Apparatus (SDA)
- Can print liquid metal in powder support to imitate RLP with different materials (faster since it cools in seconds and reversible by melting)
- Self Healing typically uses a bilayer which, when punctured, causes an interaction to expand or harden the material
- Important to build disassembly into products to make them easier to recycle

 The Future of Matter is Evolving
- Blending Disciplines
- Common Platform (to reduce complexity with so many new techniques, mechanisms, and experiments)
- Self-Replication
- Mass Speciation (with mass replication, we want to carry information, mutations, and evolution with each generation)
- Material AI
