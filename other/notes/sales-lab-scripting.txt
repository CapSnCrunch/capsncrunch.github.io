Sales Lab Scripting
- High velocity sales (3 months or less)
- Gatekeeper < Decision Maker
- SDRs
- Team 19 of 2010
- “Script” has bad connotations because of misconceptions, don’t know the “art of scripting”
- Some try to copy high performers which do well based on what the customer is saying in the moment, so the pitches are not replicable
- Even high performers don’t understand at a deep level why what they’re doing works, it’s just intuition
- Even managers don’t give good advice, may even be contradictory, because they can’t listen to all calls so just give generic advice
- Good scripts themselves inspire the confidence that’s is sought via motivation
- Where can I get lead data to practice these types of scripts on?
- Have they experimented at the intonation level for scripts? To what degree are things planned?
    - Definitely tonality, the feeling you give the prospect
    - More than half conversation is nonverbal, which can only be conveyed over the phone with tonality (article to back this up)
    - Think of yourself as an actor for applicant within that industry
- Just tries to creatively get back on path
- Well crafted script is like a GPS
- Gives many on / off ramps (why do I want off ramps?)
- MUST be effective (should turn “nos” to “yeses” at a high rate, persuasive)
- MUST be efficient (should be as short as possible while maintaining effectiveness, high close rate)
- MUST be repeatable (everyone should understand it, be universal)
- Setup pitch to make a sale within 2 calls (other scenarios may come up, but this is the target)
- Call 1: set a demo and provide value propositions, collect personalized information for the demo, should be very brief, getting them excited about the demo is the goal
    - Different scripts for warm vs cold
    - Managing Gatekeepers (do you know the decision maker or not? “Hi, yes {first name} please.”, power of “just”, “thanks”, if you don’t know they’re name ask for help “who handles XYZ”)
    - Assume you’ve reached the decision maker
    - “This is” vs “my name is” with full name and company name at a confident speed
    - “Are you familiar with {company name}?”
    - Timestamping to let them know this will be quick
    - CBS (confidence building statement)
    - Don’t pitch features, pitch benefits
    - After pitch, don’t pause, ask for demo, and give explicit options
    - “Best number for a text reminder”
    - “If you love the product, is there anyone else in that decision process?”
    - Expecting Objections
    - “Send me an email”
    - “Not Interested”
- Call 2: longer detailed product demonstration, longer call, wont be prepared to craft objections if they can’t personalize as well in call 1
    - Accumulating 
    - Getting to know you, getting to 
    - know us, pricing and logistics
    - Time based incentive
    - Door closing questions
    - Double down on CBSs
    - No time checks
    - Clear timeline to build mental image of next steps
- Categorizing customer personalities
    - A: already sold, easy going, rare (1%)
    - B: in the middle, allow a pitch, might have some objections, reasonable (80-90%)
    - F: predisposed against selling and/or your product in general, near impossible, not worth it (10-20%)
- Proactive objection elimination (8 mile approach)
- Isolating the objection
- Making invisible revenue visible
- Building intel so we can proactively pitch (to build credibility)
