Algorithms to Live By
Optimal Stopping
- Look then leap (37% rule)
- Threshold rule (immediate acceptance above some bound)

Explore / Exploit
- Gittins Index (optimal decision by number of wins vs number of losses)

Sorting

Caching
- Cache hierarchy
- Belady’s Algorithm (clairvoyant)
- Random Eviction
- First In, first out
- Least recently used
- Forgetting curves (Ebbinghaus)

Scheduling
- Single Machine (many multi-machine are intractable)
- Earliest Due Date
- Thrashing (being completely preoccupied with metawork)
- Interrupt Coalescing (assigning minimal time allotted for each task)
- Priority Inheritance

Bayes Rule

Overfitting
- Fitting polynomials
- Cross-validation (building model with subset of data and testing it against the complement)
- Regularization (constraints which penalize complexity)
- Lasso (regularization technique penalizing with the total weight of variables)
- Early Stopping (regularization technique)

Relaxation
- Discrete (dropping constraints)
- Continuous (allowing non-discrete solutions)
- Lagrangian (turning constraints into costs)

Randomness
- Monte Carlo Methods (sampling)
- Randomized algorithms
- Bloom Filter (probabilistic data structure that checks items against a Rabin-Miller-like function to check for novelty)
- Hill Climbing (finds local maximum)
- Metropolis Algorithm (hill climbing with occasional bad solutions accepted to jitter towards the global max)
- Simulated Annealing (metropolis algorithm where probability of jittering is high and then “cools” to only accepting good solutions)

Networking
- Packet Switching (TCP)
- ACKs (serially incremented)
- Exponential Backoff (double delay each time you try between successive failures)
- AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease - after a single failure, number of packets increases by 1 and decreases by half, TCP Sawtooth)
- Linguistic Flow Control (hmm, yeah, uh-huh, oh, etc.)
- Tail Drop (every packet beyond a network buffer filling is dropped)

Game Theory
- Recursive Anticipation
- Nash Equilibrium (set of moves where neither player would regret their move)
- Algorithmic Game Theory
- “The price of anarchy”
