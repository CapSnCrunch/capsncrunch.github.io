Contraceptives and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance
Population and Sex
- There was not really a concept of abstinence in antiquity but lots of restraint in late Middle Ages (1200-1500)
- Coitus Interruptus appeared in the Old Testament; was likely misinterpreted as sin
- This was not discussed in Roman literature at all even though all other aspects of sex were described in detail
- Pessaries (vaginal suppositories) are frequently mentioned in literature
- Abortion was always available, but often recommended against
- Roman medical writer Scribonius misinterprets the Hippocratic oath as being anti-abortion
- Analyzing female pubis bones for estimated number of births show a decline from 5 to 3.3 over the period 1500 BC - 120 AD (discredits infanticide / exposure hypothesis)
- Can conclude classical people were regulating family sizes somehow

Evidence for Oral Contraceptives and Abortifacients
- 19th century European medicine used ergotine alkaloids as oral contraceptives
- Rabbinic interpretation allowed women to use contraception but began turning to stoic thoughts
- Aristotle suggested that the conceptus had a soul at 40 days for males and 90 for females
- Classically, it depended on whether the features of an aborted fetus could be discerned but law nor religious sanctions were in place

Soranus on Antifertility Agents
- Prolific gynecology writer of the second century
- Described pomegranate skin in suppository recipes as an abortifacient (modern studies show it to be a contraceptive)
- Rats chance of pregnancy decreased by 28% when eating pomegranate and returned to normal after 40 days
- Actions that terminate pregnancy are produced by agents called ecbolics, oxytocics, and emengagoues in modern medicine 
- Cyrenaic acid (silphium), used in Soranus’ oral abortifacient recipes, is now extinct but was once a major attractor of Cyrene, North Africa
- Closely related is asafetida which has the primary agent Ferujol (had a 100% success rate in animal experiments in 1963 up to 3 days after coitus)
- Rue was used throughout Latin America in tea as an abortifacient (in lab tests, it’s use as a contraceptive is more clear, blocking 50-60% of pregnancies)
- Soranus not only described drugs but regime changes (avoiding intercourse during fertile period, etc.)

Terminology in Dioscorides’ De Materia Medica 
- Dioscorides was the authority on ancient pharmacy and was much more precise in describing the specific actions of various plant abortifacients
- The modern “pill” is a combination of estrogen and progestin

Early Stage Abortifacients in Dioscorides and Soranus
- Soranus recommended just doing the opposite of the regime to prevent miscarriages in order to intentionally abort (heavy lifting, exercise, diuretic concoctions, etc.)
- There are several other plant families that are considered contraceptives because they have estrogen
- Many types of mint, including pennyroyal can cause abortions (pennyroyal oil is a modern, highly concentrated form)
- Periklymenon (possibly honey suckle) was said by Dioscorides to make men barren for 37 days (the description of the plant leaves doubt to its identity)

Ancient Society and Birth Control Agents
- Myrrha was a the Greek mythological daughter of Theias doomed to an incestuous relationship (escaped by becoming the plant myrrh which has the property of being an abortifacient to rescue daughters in distress of incest)
- Pennyroyal appeared in plays by Aristophanes
- Ancient Greek, Roman, and Hebrew law did not protect a fetus until legal acknowledgment by the father that it was a child

Egyptian Papyrus Sources
- The earliest medical record from Egypt (1850 BC) has fragments of prescriptions for vaginal suppositories
- Arabic medical records call for crocodile and elephant feces in suppositories (though this is unlikely to have an effect)
- The Egyptian god Seth associated with crocodiles is also associated with birth and is often found on uterine amulets for assistance in menstruation, birth, conception, abortion, etc.
- Other recipes called for myrrh and soda or saltpeter which likely would have worked by changing pH levels
- An interesting abortion recipe from Ebers Medical Papyrus (~1500 BC) one part onion, one part wine to “extract blood of a woman”
- Ideas of drug based contraception are as old as medical records themselves

Greek and Roman Medicine from Hippocrates to Galen
- A Hippocratic treatise describes its first oral contraceptive as copper (misy) dissolved in water; possibly related to copper IUDs which block sperm
- Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) was an eclectic Roman who wrote an encyclopedia; he was admittedly reluctant to transmit birth control information but did nonetheless with his personal opinions included

The Late Roman Empire and Early Middle Ages
- Ancients learned that plants affected fertility through observation of connections between food people ate and it’s resulting activity
- Another way was to observe the behavior of animals (local cattle don’t feed on Attica, but imported cattle eat it and die)
- Latin translations were sometimes reluctant to specify about abortions or would leave out information about which plants contained contraceptive properties
- Marcellus Empiricus recorded many prescriptions but did not seem to have a lot of medical knowledge

The Middle Ages: The Church, Macer, and Hildegard
- The church in the Middle Ages wanted to control sexual behavior but abortion as homicide was not a part of law yet
- Salian Law: if someone administers something that kills a free-born, pregnant woman, they are fined 700 solidi and 200 more if the child dies
- In some cases, contraception was illegal but was unclear because of the homicide aspect or because it was perceived as magical (nonetheless, it was a step toward legal control by making the woman responsible)
- An Allemanian law fined abortions more if it were discernibly female (indirectly fining more if it’s early or late)
- Can’t make generalizations about perceptions during the Middle Ages (another case claims that abortifacients are evil magic and the one responsible is the person to administer them)
- Later, an explicit law based the punishment based on before/after 40 days from conception
Salerno and Medicine through the Late Middle Ages
- “On Degrees” lists emmenagogues by strength in 4 levels
- Translation of Arabic texts into Latin censored many of the chapters on abortion
- Trotula, female gynecologist at Salerno (existence disputed)

Islam, Arabic Medicine, and the Late Middle Ages
- Oral contraceptives were abundant in Islam (the soul entered a conceptus at 120 days)

Knowledge of Birth Control in the West
- Assimilation of Arabic knowledge into western medicine dates back to when the western idea of a university was started
- University education became a requirement to be a physician (13th century)
- Peter of Spain (1210 AD) was a physician who wrote “Thesaurus pauperum” (treasure of the poor) which gave birth control advice; he later became Pope John XXI

The Renaissance
- Botany was born and was separated from pharmacy
- For the most part, humanists were dedicated to retranslating original manuscripts directly
- However, it seemed that Renaissance writers knew less about birth control agents than in the Middle Ages (not know why, but it’s possibly related to the shift to university education and a focus on theory over clinical practice)
