          <h3>It's been a few months since I've had the chance to write an article. I did several things this past semester including operating math club, diving deeper into the Russian
            language, making a startup with my roomate (which I'll talk about later), and graduating from UT!
          </h3>
          <h3>For anyone who knows me, you'll know that my plan for essentially my entire academic career has been to pursue a graduate level degree and join a research lab. The major change
            I went through this semester was deciding that I'd rather pursue industry (or at least try it for a few years). This has come with a major shift in my study habits to focus more on
            web development as opposed to recreational and applied mathematics.
          </h3>
          <h3>This article has a few purposes:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Act as a snapshot of my web development knowledge/opinions to look back on later and track my progress</li>
            <li>Summarize my first experience with the process of creating a startup</li>
            <li>Make plans for the next major tools I want to learn</li>
            <li>Get back into the habit of writing regular articles</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>So without further ado, let's jump into what I've learned the past couple of years that let me create this Ecommerce website.</h3>
          
          <h3><strong>My past few years with web development</strong></h3>
          <h3><u>Middle / High School</u>: My first introduction to coding was somewhere in middle school (back in 2014), where I started learning <u>JavaScript</u> on <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming'>Khan Academy</a>.
          All throughout middle and high school, I made most of my <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/GameMasterX/projects'>projects</a> through the site's built in canvas tool and learning bits of <u>Java</u>
          through some of my classes. Overall, this was a great learning experience, but looking back, I wish my introduction to coding had been completely different.</h3>

          <h3>The major issue I faced without knowing it was that I didn't learn much coding because I didn't realize there was any more.</h3>
          <h3>Of course, this sounds silly now. Any software engineer is aware that there are so many languages and tools (and many more being invented every year) that they could never possibly learn everything about all of them.
            The drawback to learning JavaScript through Khan Academy is that when the sites tutorials ran out, I felt confident I knew most of what I needed to know and the only thing left to do was to apply it to projects. I also grew too
            familiar with the built-in coding panel and was never really pushed to explore a real IDE or set up any tools myself.
          </h3>
          <h3>Watching the tutorials had worked well for me with math; most of calculus and linear algebra are pretty well covered by the video series available, so I thought learning computer science would be similar. Turns out, although I had learned
            a good amount of the basics, there was a lot more coming.
          </h3>

          <h3><u>Early college</u>: My first semester, I took a course which introduced me to <u>Python</u>. The material was nothing new to me really, just a different syntax. What really opened my eyes further was the second semester when I took
          a course on <u>Data Structures</u>. I realized how much more there was to learn and finally started diving into learning things which would come to be a lot more interesting.</h3>

          <h3>Within a year or so, I had added <u>NumPy</u>, <u>SciPy</u>, <u>R</u>, <u>MATLAB</u>, <u>Pygame</u>, <u>HTML</u>, <u>CSS</u>, <u>jQuery</u>, <u>VSCode</u>, along with a couple others to my repertoire. Most of these were still
          learned with the purpose of pursuing a PhD in math, so I went much further with things adjacent to Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing than I did with Web Development.</h3>

          <h3>I also had the opportunity of attending a few REU's remotely through <a href = 'reu_computational_imaging.html'>Harvey Mudd College</a> and <a href = 'reu_social_insect_networks.html'>Arizona State University</a> which really forced me to
          get good at parnter coding and collaboration tools / techniques like <u>Git</u> and <u>Kanban</u>.</h3>

          <h3><strong>Creating and maintaining Layolay</strong></h3>
          <h3>My roomate approached me this past fall semester with the idea to make a 3D printing ecommerce website. The idea was that many 3D models were available online to print, but individuals without a printer and a few years of
          printing experience were unable to make them effectively. Sites also existed for manufacturers to print and ship custom 3D models to customers, but that usually came with a high price and the necessity for the customer to have some 3D modeling skills
          to create the design themselves, or outsource this to a third party.</h3>

          <h3>With his 6+ years of 3D printing experience and my coding experience, we figured we could make this a reality and <a href = 'https://www.layolay.com/'>Layolay</a> was born.</h3>

          <h3><strong>My upcoming goals</strong></h3>
