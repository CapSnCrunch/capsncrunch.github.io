          <h3>It's been a few months since I've had the chance to write an article. I did several things this past semester including operating math club, diving deeper into the Russian
            language, making a startup with my roomate (which I'll talk about later), and graduating from UT!
          </h3>
          <h3>For anyone who knows me, you'll know that my plan for essentially my entire academic career has been to pursue a graduate level degree and join a research lab. The major change
            I went through this semester was deciding that I'd rather pursue industry (or at least try it for a few years). This has come with a major shift in my study habits to focus more on
            web development as opposed to recreational and applied mathematics.
          </h3>
          <h3>This article has a few purposes:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Act as a snapshot of my web development knowledge/opinions to look back on later and track my progress</li>
            <li>Summarize my first experience with the process of creating a startup</li>
            <li>Make plans for the next major tools I want to learn</li>
            <li>Get back into the habit of writing regular articles</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>I want to repeat this type of article every 6 months or so, each focusing on major projects I complete during that time.
            Ideally, reflection on my progress will improve my learning during each of these intervals.
             But without further ado, let's jump into what I've learned the past couple of years that let me create this ecommerce website.</h3>
          
          <h3><strong>My past few years with web development</strong></h3>
          <h3><u>Middle / High School</u>: My first introduction to coding was somewhere in middle school (back in 2014), where I started learning <u>JavaScript</u> on <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming'>Khan Academy</a>.
          All throughout middle and high school, I made most of my <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/GameMasterX/projects'>projects</a> through the site's built in canvas tool and learned bits of <u>Java</u>
          through some of my classes. Overall, this was a great learning experience, but looking back, I wish my introduction to coding had been completely different.</h3>

          <h3>The major issue I faced without knowing it was that I didn't learn much coding because I didn't realize how much more I had to learn and how to go about acquiring that knowledge.</h3>

          <h3>The drawback to learning JavaScript through Khan Academy is that when the sites tutorials ran out, I felt confident I knew most of what I needed to know and the only thing left to do was to apply it to projects. I also grew too
            familiar with the built-in coding panel and was never really pushed to explore a real IDE or set up any tools myself.
          </h3>
          <h3>Watching the tutorials had worked well for me with math; most of calculus and linear algebra are pretty well covered by the video series available, so I thought learning computer science would be similar. Turns out, although I had learned
            a good amount of the basics, there was a lot more coming.
          </h3>

          <h3><u>Early college</u>: My first semester, I took a course which introduced me to <u>Python</u>. The material was nothing new to me really, just a different syntax. What really opened my eyes further was the second semester when I took
          a course on <u>Data Structures</u>. I realized how much more there was to learn and finally started diving into learning things which would come to be a lot more interesting.</h3>

          <h3>Within a year or so, I had added <u>NumPy</u>, <u>SciPy</u>, <u>R</u>, <u>MATLAB</u>, <u>Pygame</u>, <u>HTML</u>, <u>CSS</u>, <u>jQuery</u>, <u>VSCode</u>, along with a couple others to my repertoire. Most of these were still
          learned with the purpose of pursuing a PhD in math, so I went much further with things adjacent to Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing than I did with Web Development.</h3>

          <h3>I also had the opportunity of attending a few REU's remotely through <a href = 'reu_computational_imaging.html'>Harvey Mudd College</a> and <a href = 'reu_social_insect_networks.html'>Arizona State University</a> which really forced me to
          get good at <u>partner coding</u> and collaboration tools / techniques like <u>Git</u> and <u>Kanban</u>.</h3>

          <h3><strong>Creating and maintaining Layolay</strong></h3>
          <h3>My roomate approached me this past fall semester with the idea to make a 3D printing ecommerce website. The idea was that many 3D models were available online to print, but individuals without a printer and a few years of
          printing experience were unable to make them effectively. Sites also existed for manufacturers to print and ship custom 3D models to customers, but that usually came with a high price and the necessity for the customer to have some 3D modeling skills
          to create the design themselves, or outsource this to a third party.</h3>

          <h3>With his 6+ years of 3D printing experience and my coding experience, we figured we could make this a reality and <a href = 'https://www.layolay.com/'>Layolay</a> was born.
          I'll use this section to talk about the tools we use, what I thought of them, and things we plan to do when rebuilding the site. I learned a lot about startups in general during this process,
          but since this is a snapshot of my web experience, I'll keep my discussion to the software development aspects of our process.</h3>

          <h3>Since we are relatively new developers, we decided to use <u><a href = 'https://firebase.google.com/'>Firebase</a></u> along with <u><a href = 'https://reactjs.org/'>React</a></u>, which are great for setting up an application quickly and easily.
          We also used <u><a href = 'https://trello.com/en-US'>Trello</a></u> and regular Scrum meetings to make sure we had an agreed upon vision for what we were coding.</h3>

          <h3><u>Trello and Scrum for Organization</u>: Using Trello was invaluable for our organization as a team. For those that haven't used it, its a good idea to set up a lists for things that need to be done,
          things that are currently being done, things that are finished and need to be reviewed, and things that have been reviewed. Whenever you have a meeting, you think if things need to be added to the first section, and
          then you can go through the list of items and score them based on the amount of time they will take to complete. High difficulty tasks can be broken into smaller ones and then each person can then claim a number of items which are 
          reasonable for them to complete before the next meeting.</h3>

          <h3>
          For future projects, I think our meetings should have focused more heavily on the architecture of our system. The TODO items ended up being things like features, pages, and bug fixes that we would just claim and work on individually,
          but in a better organized project, we would have discussed as a group how the code for each of these would be laid out at a higher level. We ended up with similar pages and components having slightly different conventions and architecture
          styles which probably could have been avoided if we planned out what would work best on paper first.
