              I came across the need to generate n-many unique-looking colors for a research project visualization. 
              It turns out using the traditional RGB or HSV color models with random values is actually pretty bad at generating
              perceptually distinct colors. Digging a bit into the field of color science, this article comes across some models
              built for this sort of thing (CIE XYZ and CIE LAB) and discusses an approach that lets us get exactly the result we
              were looking for.

        <h3>Hello! Hope everyone had a wonderful winter break.</h3>
        <h3>
          I've finally wrapped up all my grad school applications and I've been
          able to spend some time learning React and thinking about a problem I
          encountered while making a game this past semester. The problem arose
          when I needed to come up with a bunch of unique random colors for
          objects in the game. It reminded me of
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZBwsm6B280"
            >Bertrand's Paradox</a
          >
          in that depending on which
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model">color model</a>
          we use to represent our colors, the amount of randomness in the
          results could vary widely.
        </h3>
        <h3><strong>Introduction to Color Science</strong></h3>
        <h3>
          Color science is the study of human perception of colors. In
          displaying colors on machines such as computer monitors, tv screens,
          and our phones, it can be very useful to have a mathematical
          description of colors. Color science gives us the idea of a
          <strong>color space</strong>, which is exactly the sort of
          mathematical model we want for this. Some common models you may be
          familiar with are RGB, HSV, and CMYK which describe colors as points
          in three or four dimensional space.
        </h3>

        <h3><strong>Generating Colors</strong></h3>
        <h3>
          Say we want a set of random colors to distinctively label some
          objects. Our first approach might just be choosing to use the standard
          HSV color model for artists and uniformly picking values for each of
          hue, saturation, and value. Doing this gives us the following:
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
        <img src="resources/random-hsl.png" width="300px" style="max-width: 100%" />
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <h4>
          Random colors created by uniformly sampling each of the hue,
          saturation, and value coordinates
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left; margin: 0 10px">
        <h3>
          This wasn't so great, a lot of the colors end up looking fairly
          similar which is exactly what we don't want to happen. The reason for
          this is that certain regions of the HSV color space have a lot of
          similarities. For example, if the value (brightness) is low, all of
          the colors will end up looking black, or if the saturation is low, all
          of the colors will look gray despite them having uniformly random
          hues.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Maybe if we use the RGB color model, we can get some better results:
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
        <img src="resources/random-rgb.png" width="300px" style="max-width: 100%" />
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <h4>
          Random colors created by uniformly sampling each of the red, green,
          and blue coordinates
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left; margin: 0 10px">
        <h3>
          This gave us significantly better results! This is where we can see
          the resemblance of our problem to Bertrand's Paradox. The randomness
          of our colors depends on the coordinate system to select them. The RGB
          colors are good, but there are still quite a few of them that are too
          close to one another. This begs the questions: what is the best space
          to use when generating colors?
        </h3>
        <h3><strong>The CIE LAB Color Space</strong></h3>
        <h3>
          One of the issues with the RGB and HSV models is that they are not
          <strong>perceptually uniform</strong>. That is, the euclidean distance
          between colors in these spaces isn't necessarily proportional with our
          perceived distance between the colors. This problem was addressed with
          the creation of <strong>CIE LAB</strong> by the International
          Commission on Illumination in 1976. Although its not particularly
          important for how we will be using the color space, I'd like to talk a
          bit about how it was created since I found it pretty interesting.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In 1931, the <strong>CIE RGB</strong> color space was created with the
          intention of getting a basis of colors which could be used to
          represent the entirety of the human percievable color space. This was
          done through great effort by having many test participants use varying
          levels of brightness of red, green, and blue light sources to match
          colors that were presented to them. The idea was that the three types
          of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell">cone cells</a> in
          our eyes roughly corresponding to red, green, and blue could be used
          to additively construct all colors we humans were able to see. The
          experiments ended with the following chart:
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
        <img src="resources/cie-rgb.png" width="400px" style="max-width: 100%" />

      <div style="text-align: center">
        <h4>CIE RGB color component color functions</h4>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left; margin: 0 10px">
        <h3>
          Notice that for some wavelengths, participants needed a 'negative'
          intensity of red light to reconstruct the color shown to them. This
          means that in order to match the target color, red had to be added to
          the target color to be able to get a percieved match. This tells us is
          that red, green, and blue alone are not able to constructively add to
          all of the possible colors in the visible spectrum.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Enter the <strong>CIE XYZ</strong> color space created in the same
          year as CIE RGB. X, Y, and Z represent three theoretical colors from
          which nonnegative values alone could be used to construct all possible
          wavelengths. Although shown in red, green, and blue below, X, Y, and Z
          are 'imaginary' colors constructed mathematically to give us this
          desired nonnegative property.

          From CIE XYZ, the CIE LAB color space was created in 1976 with

            >these</a
          >
          conversions between the coordinates. The idea for getting the space to
          be perceptually uniform was to look at a set of
          <strong>MacAdam Ellipses</strong> across the space. These ellipses are
          regions of a chromaticity diagram (a 2D slice of a color space with
          constant luminance) which consist of perceptually indistinguishable
          colors.

          Nice! Now we have a space where the euclidean distance between
          coordinate values representing the colors actually corresponds to our
          perceptual difference! (As a note, CIELAB is not perfectly
          perceptually uniform. Adjustments have been made to create slightly
          different colorspaces which do a better job of this, but CIELAB is
          still pretty good.)
        </h3>
        <h3><strong>Generating Colors Using CIE LAB</strong></h3>
        <h3>
          There are a few different methods we can try to get well spaced
          colors. If the goal is to maximize the minimum of the pairwise
          distances between colors we generate, the two best methods we could
          use are likely the ones covered in
          <a href="https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/theory/">this</a>
          article. Here, they use a method of repulsion in which each of the
          points in CIELAB representing a color push each other away with some
          force vector resulting in n maximally spaced colors. The other option
          they use in k-means clustering which also gives some nice results.
          Since both of these are already talked about there, I'd like to try
          something different.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In particular, instead of trying to maximize the distance between each
          of the colors, I want to see what a color pallete would look like with
          n evenly spaced colors. My idea for this is to select points on some
          lattice in CIELAB to get an array of colors which are perceptually the
          same distance apart from their adjacent colors in the pallete.
        </h3>

          The gif above shows what we get when we look at the simple cubic
          lattice intersected with CIELAB. We can snake through the points in
          our lattice and lay out the colors associated with those points to see
          what our evenly spaced color pallete looks like:

        <h3>
          The resulting colors have a nice distinction to them. There are a few
          that feel a little close here because we generated so many, but
          because we are using CIELAB, we have a minimum guaranteed perceptual
          difference between any pair of colors.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          I'm pretty satisfied with these results! The colors the generator is
          making are distinct enough for what I wanted to do with my other
          project and have a nice cohesiveness to them. I'd like to come back to
          this project in a future article though and see what happens when we
          intersect CIELAB with different lattices and surfaces and how the
          color palletes change when we apply transformations to these regions.
