          <h3>Hello! Hope everyone had a wonderful winter break.</h3>
          <h3>I've finally wrapped up all my grad school applications and I've been able to spend some time learning React and thinking about a problem I encountered while making
            a game this past semester. The problem arose when I needed to come up with a bunch of unique random colors for objects in the game. It reminded me of 
            <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZBwsm6B280'>Bertrand's Paradox</a> in that depending on which <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model'>color model</a>
            we use to represent our colors, the amount of randomness in the results could vary widely.
          </h3>
          <h3><strong>Introduction to Color Science</strong></h3>
          <h3>Color science is the study of human perception of colors. In displaying colors on machines such as computer monitors, tv screens, and our phones, it can
            be very useful to have a mathematical description of colors. Color science gives us the idea of a <strong>color space</strong>, which is exactly the sort of
            mathematical model we want for this. Some common models you may be familiar with are RGB, HSV, and CMYK which describe colors as points in three or four dimensional
            space.

          <h3><strong>Generating Colors</strong></h3>
          <h3>Say we want a set of random colors to distinctively label some objects. Our first approach might just be choosing to use the standard HSV color model for artists
            and uniformly picking values for each of hue, saturation, and value. Doing this gives us the following:
          </h3>

          <img src = 'resources/random-hsl.JPG', width = '300px'>
        </div>
        <div style = 'text-align: center;'>
          <h4>Random colors created by uniformly sampling each of the hue, saturation, and value coordinates</h4>
        </div>
        <div style = 'text-align: left;'>
          <h3>This wasn't so great, a lot of the colors end up looking fairly similar which is exactly what we don't want to happen. The reason for this is that
            certain regions of the HSV color space have a lot of similarities. For example, if the value (brightness) is low, all of the colors will end up looking black, or if
            the saturation is low, all of the colors will look gray despite them having uniformly random hues.
          </h3>
          <h3>Maybe if we use the RGB color model, we can get some better results:</h3>

        </div>
        <div style = 'text-align: center;'>
          <h4>Random colors created by uniformly sampling each of the red, green, and blue coordinates</h4>
        </div>
        <div style = 'text-align: left;'>
          <h3>This gave us significantly better results! This is where we can see the resemblance of our problem to Bertrand's Paradox. The randomness of our colors depends on the
            coordinate system to select them. The RGB colors are good, but there are still quite a few of them that are too close to one another. This begs the questions: what is the best
            space to use when generating colors?
          </h3>
          <h3><strong>The CIE L*a*b Color Space</strong></h3>
          <h3>One of the issues with the RGB and HSV models is that they are not <strong>perceptually uniform</strong>. That is, the euclidean distance between color differences in these
          spaces isn't necessarily proportional with our perceived distance between the colors. </h3>
