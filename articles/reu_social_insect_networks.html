          <h3>This summer, I attended the QRLSSP REU at Arizona State University online. We spent the first few weeks learning various mathematical tools for modeling topics in the life Sciences
          such as pandemic simulations, population growth, immunology, etc. Many of these are well worth spending a whole article on so look forward to those in the coming months! After This
          curriculum, we spent another four weeks in smaller groups working on projects we came up with. My group of two undergrads, one graduate student mentor, and one faculty mentor decided to
          focus on social insects.</h3>
          <h3>I had seen a few interesting <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_e0CA_nhaE&t'>videos</a> on ants by Kurzgesagt (a wonderful informative channel on YouTube) and thought they would
          be fun to learn more about. On forming our group, we had no idea what sorts of problems there were to study about ants, so we spent a week reading dozens of articles from the past few decades
          on social insects and how they pass information between one another.</h3>
          <h3>We learned that there are three main ways social insects pass information; antennation, trophallaxis, and pheromonally. They are each used to pass different types of information with antennation
            being used for general purpose communication, tropallaxis for direct transfer of food, and pheromones for nest construction and paths from and between nests.</h3>

          <h3>Previous work had been done studying how ants pass information around by making models with simple boundaries and comparing them to experimental data. We can often tell when an
            ant has recieved a message when their speed increases and movement becomes more erratic. This is called the ants alarm response. What our group was interested in was how information
            flows through a colony when interactions are occuring within more complex nest structures. Interconnected tunnels and chambers of various sizes are expected to have some effect on the
            efficiency of this process so we wanted to understand via simulation what the potential benefits of various nest structures might be.</h3>
            <h3>The way we did this was by adapting a model from an earlier work by <a href = 'http://www.public.asu.edu/~ykang3/'>Yun Kang</a>, who we met with several times to get recommendations
            on what changes could be made.</h3>
          <h3><strong>Our Model</strong></h3>
          <h3>We went with a discrete-time agent-based model in which ants have a number of attributes including location, task, walking style, and information status. The nest is represented by
            some connected subset <math><mi>X</mi><mo>&#x2282;</mo><msup><mi>&#8484;</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>. The location of ant <math><mi>A</mi></math> at time <math><mi>t</mi></math> is a unique 
            <math><mi>l</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>&#x2208;</mo><mi>X</mi></math>, the task <math><mi>p</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>)</mo></math> is an natural number less than
            <math><mi>P</mi></math> (the number of task zones such as food processing area, brood care, etc.), walking style is either drifted (<math><mi>D</mi></math>) or random (<math><mi>R</mi></math>),
            and information status is a boolean value. The task zones <math><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></math> are subsets of <math><mo>X</mo></math> which represent areas of isolation seen in real ant colonies. Our model assumes that ants will
            tend to segregate themselves into their task zones and that ants which have drifted walking style will do this by walking directly towards their task zone when separated from it.</h3>
          <h3>Initializing the simulation, <math><mi>N</mi></math> ants randomly populate the nest structure stored as a matrix and are updated according to the following update step:</h3>

        <div style = 'text-align: center;'>
          <h4>Each time step, this update step is run for all ants in a random order</h4>
          <br>

          <h3>Here is an example of a simulation over a couple hundred time steps.</h3>

          <h3><strong>Our Metrics</strong></h3>
          <h3>In our readings of previous papers, we found a number of ways to analyze interactions networks. These included Spatial Heterogeneity Degree (essentially the amount of variance in ant location over time),
            total informed population over time, contact rates between and within task groups, and the number of <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif'>motifs</a> seen in the time-aggregated network. We
            decided to track each of these while varying density of ants in the nest, spatial fidelity (proportion of ants which have directed walking style), and the shape of the nest itself in order to cast a wide net
            searching for interesting results.
