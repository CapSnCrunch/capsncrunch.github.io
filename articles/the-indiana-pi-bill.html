              A funny historical incident where Pi = 3.2 was almost codified into Indiana State Law and some additional mathematical background
              on the topic of geometric constructions in general for those that are interested.

          You'll have to forgive me. I'm writing this article hastily on 3/15 to release as my belated Pi Day post. I was actually
          searching for an intriguing math fact or some interesting proof to write about on the subject of Pi as I did with 
          <a href="elementary_not_easy_irrationality_of_pi.html">Elementary Not Easy: The Irrationality of Pi</a> a few years ago but nothing
          struck me yesterday until, of course, as I was lying in bed last night. Scrolling through my phone just before sleeping, I saw this meme
          on Reddit:

        <h3>Reading into the story behind it a bit, I found it had just enough historical intrigue and a good enough proportion of geometry to talk about.
          This was the article I wanted to write about and is now my new favorite math fact about Pi (aside from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem">Buffon's Needle</a>).

        <h3><strong>The Story of the Indiana Pi Bill</strong></h3>
        <h3>Centuries had it been unknown whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle">squaring the circle</a> was possible with traditional 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction">geometric construction</a> (a compass and straightedge). But in 1882
          Lindemann and Weierstrass had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindemann%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem">proven a theorem</a> which, as a consequence, established that the transcendence of Pi which, as a further consequence, made
          the ancient task impossible. The problem now determined, joined a group of other well known 
          <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/questionCorner/impossconstruct.html">impossible classic constructions of geometry</a>. This did not stop
          Edward J. Goodwin, a physician from Solitude, Indiana from believing he had a solution 15 years later in 1897. He had published on Goodwin's model circle
          to the American Mathematical Monthly that in fact there was a solution to the "impossible" construction:

          <h4 style='margin-top: 20px;'>Goodwin's model circle (the proposed solution to squaring the circle with compass and straightedge)</h4>
        </div>

        <h3>As a gesture of goodwill, he wanted to contribute his finding as a gift to Education in the State of Indiana by codifing his model into law with
          the <a href="https://www.springssoft.com/downloads/Reading_Journals/Essays/PI%20Bill.pdf">ENGROSSED HOUSE BILL No. 246</a>. Now, take a moment to yourself
          reader, and see the immediate flaw with the model above. With the numbers provided, you can likely prove to yourself fairly quickly that Ï€ = 3.2 exactly. This 
          had likely slipped by the legislature since they may not have understood the <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Squaring_the_Circle/Fallacious_Proof/Edward_J._Goodwin">"proof"</a> 
          that was provided to them. 
        </h3>

        <h3>Luckily, on the day of the bill's proposal, Purdue University mathematics professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Abiathar_Waldo">Clarence Waldo</a>
          happened to be present for an unrelated matter (seeking the annual appropriation for the Indiana Academy of Science). Noticing the Bill in the day's schedule along with the
          impossibility of the result immediately, he discussed it with other senators before it was to be voted on. When it reached the Senate Floor, the senators Waldo had alerted got the 
          bill idefinitely postponed.
        </h3>

        <h3>The incident reached the Chicago Tribune, Indianapolis News, and other publications which all poked fun.</h3>

        <h3><strong>On Non-Impossible Geometric Constructions</h3></strong>
        
        <h3>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction">Geometric construction</a> dates back to Ancient Greece
          where mathematicians had first attempted ways to perform math algorithmically via geometry. The most basic of these included the following those to
          do with points, lines, and circles which could be extended to more complex procedures for finding fractions of angles, n-sided regular polygons, etc:

            Basic geometric constructions with compass and straightedge
          </h4>
        </div>

        <h3>After centuries, progress stalled until Gauss discovered how to construct a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptadecagon">Heptadecagon</a>
          and eventually Hilbert found a complete set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms">axioms for geometry</a> describing the field
          as an axiomatic algebra. I found this to be a pretty cool fact I did not know / think about before which can actually be fairly shortly stated:
        </h3>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <h3>Axiom System for Geometry:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Primitive Objects</h3>
              <ul>  
                <li><em>Point</em></li>
                <li><em>Line</em></li>
                <li><em>Plane</em></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Primitive Relations</h3>
              <ul>  
                <li><em>Betweenness</em> (ternary relation on points)</li>
                <li><em>Lies on (Containment)</em>, three binary relations linking points and straight lines, points and planes, and straight lines and planes</li>
                <li><em>Congruence</em> two binary relations linking line segments and linking angles</li>
              </ul>
            </li>            
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>
          With the above alone, one can construct line segments, angles, triangles, polygons, and the rest of Euclidean solid geometry. Unfortunately 
          they do not fit neatly as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">First-Order Theory</a>, but a later set of axioms by 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski">Tarksi (1926)</a> can be represented as such.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          I have not read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Constructions-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1461268451?gQT=1">this book</a> on the topic,
          but I imagine it would be quite interesting. Among its topics are Euclidean Constructions, variations of construction axioms, and paperfolding.
        </h3>

        <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
        <h3>
          Geometric constructions are a cool field of math for both their rich history and their eventual linking to algebra by Hilbert.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry">Algebraic Geometry</a> has since expanded well beyond these old problems.
          As an eventual consequence somewhere between the two Pi was proven to be a transcendal number which made the Indiana Pi Bill all the funnier
          both at the time, and still today.
