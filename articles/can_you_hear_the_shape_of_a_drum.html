          <h3>Unfortunately, no.</h3>
          <h3>You may have heard this question before though. It was first posed by mathematician Mark Kac in 1966 and took until 1992 to find an answer for the two-dimensional case.
            The question formatted in mathematical terms is asking whether the spectrum of the laplacian uniquely determines a boundary in <math><msup><mi>&#x211D;</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>
            for the Dirichlet problem:</h3>

          <h3>In 1992, Gordon, Webb, and Wolpert constructed the following isospectral regions, answering Kac's question:</h3>

        <div style = 'text-align: center;'>
          <h4>Since the sound a drum produces is entirely dependent on its eigenvalues, these two isospectral regions would produce the same noise.</h4>
        </div>
        <div style = 'text-align: left;'>
          <h3>It seems there isn't a whole lot left to work on with this problem then; an infinite family of counterexamples has been found. There is a great opportunity here though
            to get some practice with numerical methods and come up with some nice visualizations for the drum problem.</h3>
          <h3>In general, finding the explicit spectrum of a region is pretty difficult. This is part of the reason it took nearly 30 years to find this counterexample. In an afternoon
            we could find nice eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for squares, rectangles, and circles, but if given a non-regular, piece-wise defined mess, it might take us a few decades
            to work that out too.</h3>
          <h3>Enter numerical approximation. Today, we're going to talk about how we can use the <u>finite difference laplacian</u> to come up with a numerical estimate for the spectrum of a
            region. Once we've put together all of our code for this, we can test it out on the two regions above to see if we estimate about the same values.
          </h3>
          <h3><strong>Discretizing our Region</strong></h3>
          <h3>Before worrying about how to discretly approximate the laplacian operator, we need to break our region into a discrete set of points and somehow define the 2D functions
              <math><mi>u</mi></math> as vectors. To do this, we can just choose any density of a grid that we want and find the points of the grid which lie inside the region using some
              sort of <code>in_polygon()</code> function. I used <a href = 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31542843/inpolygon-for-python-examples-of-matplotlib-path-path-contains-points-method'>
              matplotlib.path</a> to get something like this:

          <h4>We can later increase the resolution of this grid to get better approximations of our spectrum.</h4>
