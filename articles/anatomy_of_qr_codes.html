          We are surrounded by barcodes of all sorts that people usually don't
          stop and think about. There's quite a bit of complexity behind matrix
          barcodes like the QR (Quick Response) code that I'd like to spend a
          bit of time breaking down to some degree. There is a lot of math
          behind the error correction we'll leave out here (I want the main
          takeaway to be the basic structure of these codes) but I found
          <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/introduction"

          amazing website that covers everything in extreme detail.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          To start, here is an image of a QR code with the main regions
          highlighted:

        <h4>
          <strong>Gray:</strong> Quiet Zone, <strong>Yellow:</strong> Finder
          Patterns, <strong>Green:</strong> Allignment Pattern,<br />

        </h4>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left">
        <h3><strong>Finder and Timing Patterns</strong></h3>
        <h3>
          Both the large finder patterns in the corners of the code and the
          horizontal and vertical timing patterns serve to make the code more
          readable by computer vision. These are relatively easy to consistently
          find in an image and can then be used to evaluate the rest of the
          grid. Another thing to notice is the lonely pixel by the bottom left
          finder pattern. This is called the <strong>dark module</strong> and is
          a square which is always black on all QR codes.
        </h3>
        <h3><strong>Format Information</strong></h3>
        <h3>
          The format information is written twice near the top left finder
          pattern and broken in two along the other two finder patterns. The
          format string is always 15 bits long. The first two bits describe the
          error correction level 00 (M), 01 (L), 10 (H), and 11 (Q). The various
          error correction levels have different data restoration capabilites. L
          can restore approximately 7% of the data, M - 15%, Q - 25%, and H -
          30%. These enable us to intentionally cover relatively large portions
          of QR codes to make artistic renditions of them that will still scan
          properly. The next three bits describe the mask pattern, the options
          of which are listed below:
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">

        <h4>The eight unique masks used to XOR with QR codes</h4>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left">
        <br />
        <h3>
          Masks work by taking the given pattern and duplicating it across the
          entire code and XORing it with the data. They are used to break up
          patterns which may be difficult to distinguish from finder patterns or
          other important features of the code. The error correction level and
          appropriate mask pattern are selected after looking at how the data is
          laid out across the code.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Lastly, the ten bits following this information are the
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction"
            >Reed-Solomon Error Correction</a
          >
          bits. These deserve an entire article of their own since they require
          quite a lot of math, but they enable the ability to have error
          correction at all. Once the full format string is determined, it is
          XORed with the final mask string 101010000010010 and written into the
          two locations shown on the code.
        </h3>
        <h3><strong>Data</strong></h3>
        <h3>
          The data written into the QR code can be formatted in a few ways
          including numeric mode, alphanumeric, byte, and kanji. The bytes used
          to represent the string being encoded are snaked through the code in
          the purple pattern shown above. Once these are laid out skipping over
          allignment and timing patterns, the mask is applied and we are
          basically done.
        </h3>
        <h3><strong>Version and Allignment Patterns</strong></h3>
        <h3>
          QR Codes have version numbers ranging from 1 to 40. Version 1 codes
          are 21x21 and the size will increase by 4 in each direction with each
          subsequent version. This means that version 40 codes are 177x177! As
          the size of these codes increase, it can be more and more difficult
          for a scanner to locate the finder patterns. To solve this, starting
          with version 2 codes, allignment patterns are added to make the code
          more manageable.

          Apologies for the relatively short article this week! School has just
          started meaning all of my extracurriculars have as well. Hopefully you
          still learned a bit from this. Stay tuned for the cool article I have
          planned for next time though!
