        <h2>REU: Computational Imaging</h2>

        <h3>In the summer after my sophomore year, I attended a data science REU through Harvey Mudd College. This was quite a broad topic so individual groups main goals varied. In my particular group with
          <a href = 'https://joshbrake.com/'>Josh Brake</a>, we worked on Biophotonics in three subgroups. This was my first introduction to the field on Computational Imaging and found myself fascinated by how widely
          used it is in modern technology. We looked at examples of telescopes, MRI machines, and phone cameras to scratch the surface before diving into the specific innerworkings of the techniques
          we would study and attempt to implement.</h3>
        <h3>Through this article, I plan to recount some of the most interesting topics we worked on as well as include some technical information on pieces of the project I knew particulary well. My subgroup of two
          worked on UC2 Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy so I will explain some of the design concepts of our UC2 system as well as the mathematics behind the FPM algorithm.</h3>
        <h3><strong>What is Computational Imaging?</strong></h3>
        <h3>In essence, computational imaging is the design and implementation of algorithms which uses data to reconstruct and image which a traditional imaging system would not be able to take. Examples of this include
          CT scans which combine multiple X-Ray images into a three dimensional image, deep space imaging which can involve recovering information from sparse data and unblurring images, and more advanced systems such as
          seeing around corners or even directly through highly diffuse materials.</h3>
