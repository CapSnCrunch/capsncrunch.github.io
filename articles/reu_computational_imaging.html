        <h3>In the summer after my sophomore year, I attended a data science REU through Harvey Mudd College. This was quite a broad topic so individual groups varied. In my particular group with
          <a href = 'https://joshbrake.com/'>Josh Brake</a>, we worked on Biophotonics. This was my first introduction to the field on Computational Imaging and found myself fascinated by how widely
          used it is in modern technology. We looked at examples of telescopes, MRI machines, and phone cameras to scratch the surface before diving into the specific innerworkings of the techniques
          we would study and attempt to implement.</h3>
        <h3>Through this article, I plan to recount some of the most interesting topics we worked on as well as include some technical information on pieces of the project I knew particulary well.</h3>
