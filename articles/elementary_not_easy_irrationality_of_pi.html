          <h3>My last semester in undergrad (hopefully) has just started! I'm excited to use this time to explore some fun projects and 
            problems I've been keeping in the notes app on my phone and add my experiences here for others to build on. This past week,
            UT Math Club just had its first meeting of the semester starting with one of my favorite speakers; 
            <a href='https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/gannonth/'>Tom Gannon</a>. Tom is currently a 6th year grad student that I volunteered
            under for Sunday Morning Math Group a few years ago. He's a very engaging math speaker and does a great job of finding topics
            that are accessible to the entire audience.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            His talk this past week was on the Irrationality of Pi, a concept any math student is familiar with, but may not know the proof for.
            There are several interesting ways to prove this, so in this article, I want to show a few of a them that I enjoy, all of which use
            only basic calculus, but none of which are particularly easy to understand conceptually.
