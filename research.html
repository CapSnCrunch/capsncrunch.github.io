          In <strong>Summer 2021</strong>, I attended my second REU online at
          Arizona State University. We spent the first four weeks learning about
          various topics in the Life Sciences and background on mathematical
          modeling. With a group of two other undergrads, a graduate student
          mentor, a faculty mentor, and
          <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~ykang3/">Yun Kang</a>, we produced
          a technical report on modeling in-nest social insect networks. Read my

          This isn't true math research but instead an opportunity for
          undergrads to study a topic of interesting with a graduate student
          mentor. I highly encourage the program for any math or physics
          students at UT. I produced

          Theory by the end of the semester.

          In <strong>Summer 2020</strong>, I attended my first REU online at
          Harvey Mudd College. The focus was on data science and I worked in a
