        <h3>My <strong>current</strong> research is in the <a href = 'https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/geometry_lab/research'>Texas Experimental Geometry Lab</a> with <a href = 'https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jdanciger/index.html'>Jeff Danciger</a> and
        <a href = 'https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/weisman/'>Teddy Weisman</a>. I am also continuing
        work with <a href = 'http://www.public.asu.edu/~ykang3/'>Yun Kang</a> from this past summer in order to publish a few papers on social insects.</h3>
        <h3>In <strong>Summer 2021</strong>, I attended my second REU online at Arizona State University. We spent the first four weeks learning about various topics in the Life Sciences and background on mathematical modeling. With a group of two other undergrads,
          a graduate student mentor, a faculty mentor, and <a href = 'http://www.public.asu.edu/~ykang3/'>Yun Kang</a>, we produced a technical report on modeling in-nest social insect networks. Read my more in-depth article 
          <a href = 'articles/reu_social_insect_networks.html'>here</a>.

        <h3>In <strong>Spring 2021</strong>, I worked with <a href = 'https://joekmiller.wordpress.com/'>Joseph Miller</a> and <a href = 'https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/10-deans-office/367-pavlovic-natasa?Itemid=349'>Natasa Pavlovic</a> under the Research Training Grant for Analysis on a mathematical 
          physics literature review. Joe and I read through the paper <em>On the Uniqueness of Solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii Hierarchy</em> by Klainerman and Machedon and I produced a poster for the undergraduate research forum which can
          be found <a href = 'resources/RTG Poster.pdf'>here</a>. I also began working with <a href = 'https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jdanciger/index.html'>Jeff Danciger</a> in the <a href = 'https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/geometry_lab/research'>Texas 
            Experimental Geometry Lab</a>. Read my article on this work <a href = 'articles/the_ping_pong_lemma.html'>here</a>.</h3>
        <h3>In <strong>Fall 2020</strong>, I participated in the <a href = ' https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/'>Directed Reading Program</a> with <a href = 'https://joekmiller.wordpress.com/'>Joseph Miller</a>. This isn't true math research but instead an 
          opportunity for undergrads to study a topic of interesting with a graduate student mentor. I highly encourage the program for any math or physics students at UT. I produced <a href = 'resources/Spectral Theory DRP.pdf'>this</a> paper on 
          Spectral Theory by the end of the semester.</h3>
        <h3>In <strong>Summer 2020</strong>, I attended my first REU online at Harvey Mudd College. The focus was on data science and I worked in a group led by <a href = 'https://joshbrake.com/'>Josh Brake</a>. To learn more about what I worked on specifically
          during this research experience, please check out my short article <a href = 'articles/reu_computational_imaging.html'>here</a>!</h3>
